## Setup and Configuration

### API Setup and Configuration (TheMealDB)

To integrate **TheMealDB** API into the YumJar App, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Retrofit and Gson dependencies added to the project

#### 1. Add Dependencies
Add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` file for Retrofit and Gson:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
}
```

#### 2. Define TheMealDB API Interface
Create an interface to define the API endpoints in Kotlin:

```kotlin
import retrofit2.Call
import retrofit2.http.GET
import retrofit2.http.Query

interface TheMealDBService {

    @GET("filter.php")
    fun getMealsByCategory(@Query("c") category: String): Call<MealsResponse>

    @GET("search.php")
    fun searchMeal(@Query("s") searchQuery: String): Call<MealsResponse>
}
```

#### 3. Initialize Retrofit
Initialize Retrofit in your main activity or application class:

```kotlin
import retrofit2.Retrofit
import retrofit2.converter.gson.GsonConverterFactory

val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build()

val mealService = retrofit.create(TheMealDBService::class.java)
```

#### 4. Make API Requests
Call the API to fetch meals based on category or search queries, for example:

```kotlin
mealService.getMealsByCategory("Breakfast").enqueue(object : Callback<MealsResponse> {
    override fun onResponse(call: Call<MealsResponse>, response: Response<MealsResponse>) {
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            val meals = response.body()?.meals
            // Update RecyclerView with meal data
        }
    }

    override fun onFailure(call: Call<MealsResponse>, t: Throwable) {
        // Handle error
    }
})
```

#### 5. Display API Data in RecyclerView
Parse and bind the API response (e.g., meal name, image) to your RecyclerView to display meals dynamically in the app.

This setup allows you to integrate **TheMealDB** API and fetch recipes for display in the **YumJar** app.

### RecyclerView for Recipes

YumJar uses `RecyclerView` for listing categories and recipes. Follow these steps:

1. Create an adapter for managing the dataset.
2. Use `ViewHolder` pattern to display recipe images, names, and categories.
3. Bind the `RecyclerView` with the `Adapter` to display the list of recipes dynamically.
